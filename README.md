The [tree annotation tool](https://dcmlab.github.io/tree-annotation-code/) is a simple and easy-to-use web app for creating trees.
The user provides a sequence of symbols and then creates a tree from bottom to top by successively combining elements.
The tool includes functionality for loading and exporting trees
in JSON or [qtree](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-qtree) format (useful for LaTeX),
as well as a preview visualization of the current tree.
Trees can be easily shared using special links that encode a tree in the URL,
[like this](https://dcmlab.github.io/tree-annotation-code/?tree=eyJsYWJlbCI6IkMiLCJjaGlsZHJlbiI6W3sibGFiZWwiOiJDIiwiY2hpbGRyZW4iOltdfSx7ImxhYmVsIjoiQyIsImNoaWxkcmVuIjpbeyJsYWJlbCI6Ikc3IiwiY2hpbGRyZW4iOlt7ImxhYmVsIjoiRG0iLCJjaGlsZHJlbiI6W119LHsibGFiZWwiOiJHNyIsImNoaWxkcmVuIjpbXX1dfSx7ImxhYmVsIjoiQyIsImNoaWxkcmVuIjpbXX1dfV19).
